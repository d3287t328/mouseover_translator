# Mouseover translation dictionary

1. Install the chrome extension (using "load unpacked" in developer mode, at the moment).
2. When you're on a page with text in one of the supported languages (Chinese, Spanish, German, Italian, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Serbo-Croatian, Japanese), click on the extension icon, and select the language in the dropdown menu.
3. Once you see an alert saying "Translations ready", you will be able to mouse over words and see dictionary entries for them.

Note that dictionary entries were scraped from Wiktionary data and format is not ideal for understanding in some cases.
